                        <h3>Plastic Water Bottles</h3>
                        <p>We would like to draw your attention to a recent incident involving marine debris that occurred on our vessel. Empty plastic water bottles were accidentally disposed of over the side of the ship. As responsible stewards of the marine environment, it is our duty to address this issue promptly and effectively.</p>
                        <p><strong>To mitigate such incidents in the future, we have decided to take the following actions:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Issuance of Personal Aluminum Water Bottles:</strong> We will be providing each crew member with a personal aluminum water bottle. By using reusable bottles, we can significantly reduce the chances of plastic waste ending up in the ocean. Please make sure to use these bottles during your time on the vessel.</p>
                        <p><strong>Placement of 5-Gallon Water Dispensers:</strong> We will be strategically installing 5-gallon water dispensers throughout the vessel to ensure easy access to clean drinking water. This initiative will help minimize the need for disposable plastic water bottles and further reduce our environmental footprint.</p>
                        <h3>Scupper Plugs</h3>
                        <p>We would like to remind all crew members about the importance of not removing scupper plugs from the ship without a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and the required permit. JSAs and permits are essential for ensuring the safety of our operations and must be signed by the Captain before any scuffer plugs are tampered with.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, let us reaffirm our commitment to being Good Stewards of the Marine Environment. By implementing these measures and following the necessary protocols, we can continue to enjoy our work while minimizing our impact on the ocean's delicate ecosystem.</p>

                        <p>We want to inform you about several important changes to our helicopter boarding procedures that are now in effect. These updates are designed to prioritize safety and well-being for all personnel during our operations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mandatory Long Sleeve Shirts in Cold Weather:</strong> As we continue to operate in cold weather conditions, it is now mandatory for all personnel to wear long sleeve shirts. This requirement is in place to ensure your comfort and protect against the cold.</p>
                        <p> <strong>Earphone Use during Flights:</strong> To enhance safety during helicopter flights, we are implementing a new policy. Personnel are not allowed to wear personal earphones during flights, except for Heliport-issued ones. This measure is crucial to maintain clear communication and situational awareness during our operations.</p>
                        <p> <strong>Negative COVID-19 Test Requirement:</strong> To safeguard the health of all personnel, it is now mandatory for everyone to arrive with a negative COVID-19 test result before entering the check-in room. This step is part of our commitment to minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission within our facility.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mandatory Temperature Check:</strong> For added safety, a mandatory temperature check will be conducted prior to entry to the facility. Individuals with a temperature reading of 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit or higher will not be permitted to fly. This precautionary measure is essential to prevent the spread of illness and maintain a safe environment for all passengers.</p>

                        <p>This week's Safety Share highlights the critical importance of reporting any new medications to our Ship Medic, which could have a significant impact on our safety and well-being.</p>
                        <p>Recently, a member of our deck crew reported to the Ship Medic with severe sunburn. His skin was red, uncomfortable, and peeling.</p>
                        <p><strong>The investigation into the incident revealed some key factors:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The worker was prescribed antibiotics but failed to read the instructions to stay out of direct sunlight while taking them.
                            Unfortunately, the worker did not report taking new medication to the Ship Medic, as per our policy.
                        </p>
                        <p>In this case, if the worker had informed the Ship Medic about the antibiotics, we could have assigned him to a work detail in a non-direct sun location, reducing the risk of sunburn.</p>
                        <p>This incident serves as a reminder that open and honest communication with our medical personnel is essential. By reporting any new medications and following their guidance, we can prevent potential health issues and work-related incidents. Let's make sure to adhere to these procedures, not only for our own safety but for the safety of our colleagues as well.</p>
                        <p><em>Safety is everyone's responsibility, and through proactive communication, we can better protect ourselves and one another.</em></p>
